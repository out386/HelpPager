# HelpPager
A very simple android library to show topic-wise, in-app help. It can also be used to show any key-value data in multiple tabs. 
The demo app is [here](https://github.com/out386/HelpPager/releases/tag/v1.0.1)  
  
To use, add this to the module level build.gradle:  
  
```repositories {  
    maven { url 'https://dl.bintray.com/out386/maven'}  
}  
  
dependencies {  
    implementation 'gh.out386:helppager:1.0.1  
}
```
  
Then, simply extend HelpPagerActivity. See the demo app.
